"Although these domains are registered through a Hong Kong-based registrar and use Chinese nameservers, the attack infrastructure is primarily hosted on popular U.S. cloud services," security researchers Reethika Ramesh, Zhanhao Chen, Daiping Liu, Chi-Wei Liu, Shehroze Farooqi, and Moe Ghasemisharif said .  The activity has been attributed to a China-linked group known as the Smishing Triad , which is known to flood mobile devices  with fraudulent toll violation and package misdelivery notices to trick users into taking immediate action and providing sensitive information.  These campaigns have proven to be lucrative, allowing the threat actors to make more than $1 billion over the last three years, according to a re...</p><p>Source: The Hacker News - <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/smishing-triad-linked-to-194000.html" target="_blank">Read Full Article</a></p><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/smishing-triad-linked-to-194000.html" target="_blank" class="button-link">Read Full Article</a></div><div class="service-card" data-aos="fade-up"><h3>Newly Patched Critical Microsoft WSUS Flaw Comes Under Active Exploitation</h3><p>Microsoft on Thursday released  out-of-band security updates to patch a critical-severity Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) vulnerability with a proof-of-concept (Poc) exploit publicly available and has come under active exploitation in the wild.  The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-59287  (CVSS score: 9.8), a remote code execution flaw in WSUS that was originally fixed by the tech giant as part of its Patch Tuesday update published last week.  Three security researchers, MEOW, f7d8c52bec79e42795cf15888b85cbad, and Markus Wulftange with CODE WHITE GmbH, have been acknowledged for discovering and reporting the bug.  The shortcoming concerns a case of deserialization of untrusted data in WSUS that allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network. It's worth noting that the vulnerability does not impact Windows servers that do not have the WSUS Server Role enabled.   In a hypothetical attack scenario, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could send a crafted even...</p><p>Source: The Hacker News - <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/microsoft-issues-emergency-patch-for.html" target="_blank">Read Full Article</a></p><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/microsoft-issues-emergency-patch-for.html" target="_blank" class="button-link">Read Full Article</a></div><div class="service-card" data-aos="fade-up"><h3>APT36 Targets Indian Government with Golang-Based DeskRAT Malware Campaign</h3><p>A Pakistan-nexus threat actor has been observed targeting Indian government entities as part of spear-phishing attacks designed to deliver a Golang-based malware known as DeskRAT .  The activity, observed  in August and September 2025 by Sekoia, has been attributed to Transparent Tribe  (aka APT36), a state-sponsored hacking group known to be active since at least 2013. It also builds upon a prior campaign disclosed  by CYFIRMA in August 2025.  The attack chains involve sending phishing emails containing a ZIP file attachment, or in some cases, a link pointing to an archive hosted on legitimate cloud services like Google Drive. Present within the ZIP file is a malicious Desktop file embedding commands to display a decoy PDF ("CDS_Directive_Armed_Forces.pdf") using Mozilla Firefox while simultaneously executing the main payload.  Both the artifacts are pulled from an external server "modgovindia[.]com" and executed. Like before, the campaign is designed to target BO...</p><p>Source: The Hacker News - <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/apt36-targets-indian-government-with.html" target="_blank">Read Full Article</a></p><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/apt36-targets-indian-government-with.html" target="_blank" class="button-link">Read Full Article</a></div><div class="service-card" data-aos="fade-up"><h3>The Cybersecurity Perception Gap: Why Executives and Practitioners See Risk Differently</h3><p>Does your organization suffer from a cybersecurity perception gap? Findings from the  Bitdefender 2025 Cybersecurity Assessment  suggest the answer is probably "yes" — and many leaders may not even realize it.  This disconnect matters. Small differences in perception today can evolve into major blind spots tomorrow. After all, perception influences what organizations prioritize, where they allocate resources, and how they respond in critical moments.  Confidence at the Top, Caution on the Ground  Bitdefender's latest assessment surveyed  1,200 cybersecurity and IT professionals , and at first glance, the results suggest optimism. An impressive  93%  say they are "somewhat" or "very confident" in their ability to manage cyber risk as the attack surface expands.  But dig deeper, and the optimism begins to split.  Nearly half ( 45% ) of C-level respondents — including CISOs and CIOs — describe themselves as "very confident" in their organization's readiness. Yet among mid-l...</p><p>Source: The Hacker News - <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/the-cybersecurity-perception-gap-why.html" target="_blank">Read Full Article</a></p><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/the-cybersecurity-perception-gap-why.html" target="_blank" class="button-link">Read Full Article</a></div><div class="service-card" data-aos="fade-up"><h3>3,000 YouTube Videos Exposed as Malware Traps in Massive Ghost Network Operation</h3><p>A malicious network of YouTube accounts has been observed publishing and promoting videos that lead to malware downloads, essentially abusing the popularity and trust associated with the video hosting platform for propagating malicious payloads.  Active since 2021, the network has published more than 3,000 malicious videos to date, with the volume of such videos tripling since the start of the year. It has been codenamed the YouTube Ghost Network  by Check Point. Google has since stepped in to remove a majority of these videos.  The campaign leverages hacked accounts and replaces their content with "malicious" videos that are centred around pirated software and Roblox game cheats to infect unsuspecting users searching for them with stealer malware. Some of these videos have racked up hundreds of thousands of views, ranging from 147,000 to 293,000.  "This operation took advantage of trust signals, including views, likes, and comments, to make malicious content seem safe,...</p><p>Source: The Hacker News - <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/3000-youtube-videos-exposed-as-malware.html" target="_blank">Read Full Article</a></p><a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/3000-youtube-videos-exposed-as-malware.html" target="_blank" class="button-link">Read Full Article</a></div></section>
