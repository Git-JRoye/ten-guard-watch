      "summary": "Threat actors have been observed leveraging malicious dropper apps masquerading as legitimate applications to deliver an Android SMS stealer dubbed Wonderland  in mobile attacks targeting users in Uzbekistan.  \"Previously, users received 'pure' Trojan APKs that acted as malware immediately upon installation,\" Group-IB said  in an analysis published last week. \"Now, adversaries increasingly deploy droppers disguised as legitimate applications. The dropper looks harmless on the surface but contains a built-in malicious payload, which is deployed locally after installation – even without an active internet connection.\"  Wonderland (formerly WretchedCat), according to the Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company, facilitates bidirectional command-and-control (C2) communication to execute commands in real-time, allowing for arbitrary USSD requests and SMS theft. It masquerades as Google Play, or files of other formats, such as videos, photos, and wedding in...",

The group has also managed to remain elusive, attracting little attention, unlike other Iranian hacking crews such as Charming Kitten , MuddyWater , and OilRig ...",

The large-scale conspiracy involved deploying malware named Ploutus  to hack into automated teller machines (ATMs) across the U.S. and force them to dispense cash. The indicted members are alleged to be part of Tren de Aragua (TdA, Spanish for \"the train of Aragua\"), a Venezuelan gang designated  a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department.   In July 2025, the U.S. government announced  sanctions  against the group's head, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores (aka Niño Guerrero), and five other key members for their involvement in the \"illicit drug trade, human smuggling and trafficking, extortion, sexual exploitation of women and children, and money laundering, among other criminal activities.\"   The Justice Department said an indictment returned on December 9, 2025, has charged a group of...",

The activity, ongoing since September 2025, is being tracked by Proofpoint under the moniker UNK_AcademicFlare .  The attacks involve using compromised email addresses belonging to government and military organizations to strike entities within government, think tanks, higher education, and transportation sectors in the U.S. and Europe.  \"Typically, these compromised email addresses are used to conduct benign outreach and rapport building related to the targets' area of expertise to ultimately arrange a fictitious meeting or interview,\" the enterprise security company said .

The campaign \"uses CountLoader as the initial tool in a multistage attack for access, evasion, and delivery of additional malware families,\" Cyderes Howler Cell Threat Intelligence team said  in an analysis.  CountLoader was previously  documented  by both Fortinet and Silent Push, detailing the loader's ability to push payloads like Cobalt Strike, AdaptixC2, PureHVNC RAT, Amatera Stealer, and PureMiner. The loader has been detected in the wild since at least June 2025.
