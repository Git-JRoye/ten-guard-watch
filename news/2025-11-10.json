      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have called attention to a massive phishing campaign targeting the hospitality industry that lures hotel managers to ClickFix-style pages and harvest their credentials by deploying malware like PureRAT .  \"The attacker's modus operandi involved using a compromised email account to send malicious messages to multiple hotel establishments,\" Sekoia said . \"This campaign leverages spear-phishing emails that impersonate Booking.com to redirect victims to malicious websites, employing the ClickFix  social engineering tactic to deploy PureRAT.\"  The end goal of the campaign is to steal credentials from compromised systems that grant threat actors unauthorized access to booking platforms like Booking.com or Expedia, which are then either sold on cybercrime forums or used to send fraudulent emails to hotel customers to conduct fraud.  The activity is assessed to be active since at least April 2025 and operational as of early October 2025. It...",

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a new set of three extensions associated with the GlassWorm campaign, indicating continued attempts on part of threat actors to target the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) ecosystem.  The extensions in question , which are still available for download, are listed below -   ai-driven-dev.ai-driven-dev  (3,402 downloads)  adhamu.history-in-sublime-merge  (4,057 downloads)  yasuyuky.transient-emacs  (2,431 downloads)    GlassWorm, first documented by Koi Security late last month, refers  to a campaign in which threat actors leverage VS Code extensions on the Open VSX Registry and the Microsoft Extension Marketplace to harvest Open VSX, GitHub, and Git credentials, drain funds from 49 different cryptocurrency wallet extensions, and drop additional tools for remote access.  What makes the malware notable is that it uses invisible Unicode characters to hide malicious code in code editors and abuses the pilfered credentials to compromise additional extens...",

      "summary": "Microsoft has disclosed details of a novel side-channel attack targeting remote language models that could enable a passive adversary with capabilities to observe network traffic to glean details about model conversation topics despite encryption protections under certain circumstances.  This leakage of data exchanged between humans and streaming-mode language models could pose serious risks to the privacy of user and enterprise communications, the company noted. The attack  has been codenamed Whisper Leak .  \"Cyber attackers in a position to observe the encrypted traffic (for example, a nation-state actor at the internet service provider layer, someone on the local network, or someone connected to the same Wi-Fi router) could use this cyber attack to infer if the user's prompt is on a specific topic,\" security researchers Jonathan Bar Or and Geoff McDonald, along with the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team, said .

Potential targets of the activity, tracked as CL-UNK-1054, are located in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Morocco based on VirusTotal submission data.
