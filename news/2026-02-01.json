      "summary": "A Farsi-speaking threat actor aligned with Iranian state interests is suspected to be behind a new campaign targeting non-governmental organizations and individuals involved in documenting recent human rights abuses.  The activity , observed by HarfangLab in January 2026, has been codenamed RedKitten . It's said to coincide with the nationwide unrest  in Iran that began towards the end of 2025, protesting soaring inflation, rising food prices, and currency depreciation. The ensuing crackdown has resulted in mass casualties  and an internet blackout .  \"The malware relies on GitHub and Google Drive for configuration and modular payload retrieval, and uses Telegram for command-and-control,\" the French cybersecurity company said.  What makes the campaign noteworthy is the threat actor's likely reliance on large language models (LLMs) to build and orchestrate the necessary tooling. The starting point of the attack is a 7-Zip archive  with a Farsi filename that contains...",

      "summary": "Google-owned Mandiant on Friday said  it identified an \"expansion in threat activity\" that uses tradecraft consistent with extortion-themed attacks orchestrated by a financially motivated hacking group known as ShinyHunters.  The attacks leverage advanced voice phishing  (aka vishing) and bogus credential harvesting sites mimicking targeted companies to gain unauthorized access to victim environments by collecting sign-on (SSO) credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes.  The end goal of the attacks is to target cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications to siphon sensitive data and internal communications and extort victims.  The tech giant's threat intelligence team said it's tracking the activity under multiple clusters, including UNC6661, UNC6671, and UNC6240  (aka ShinyHunters), so as to account for the possibility that these groups could be evolving their modus operandi or mimicking previously observed tactics.   \"While this methodo...",

      "summary": "CERT Polska, the Polish computer emergency response team, revealed that coordinated cyber attacks targeted more than 30 wind and photovoltaic farms, a private company from the manufacturing sector, and a large combined heat and power plant (CHP) supplying heat to almost half a million customers in the country.  The incident took place on December 29, 2025. The agency has attributed the attacks to a threat cluster dubbed Static Tundra , which is also tracked as Berserk Bear, Blue Kraken, Crouching Yeti, Dragonfly, Energetic Bear, Ghost Blizzard (formerly Bromine), and Havex. Static Tundra is assessed to be linked to Russia's Federal Security Service's (FSB) Center 16 unit.  It's worth noting that recent reports from ESET  and Dragos  attributed the activity with moderate confidence to a different Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as Sandworm.   \"All attacks had a purely destructive objective,\" CERT Polska said  in a report published Friday. \"Althoug...",

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have discovered malicious Google Chrome extensions that come with capabilities to hijack affiliate links, steal data, and collect OpenAI ChatGPT authentication tokens.  One of the extensions in question is Amazon Ads Blocker (ID: pnpchphmplpdimbllknjoiopmfphellj), which claims to be a tool to browse Amazon without any sponsored content. It was uploaded to the Chrome Web Store by a publisher named \"10Xprofit\" on January 19, 2026.  \"The extension does block ads as advertised, but its primary function is hidden: it automatically injects the developer's affiliate tag (10xprofit-20) into every Amazon product link and replaces existing affiliate codes from content creators,\" Socket security researcher Kush Pandya said .  Further analysis has determined that Amazon Ads Blocker is part of a larger cluster of 29 browser add-ons that target several e-commerce platforms like AliExpress, Amazon, Best Buy, Shein, Shopify, and Walmart.

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new campaign attributed to a China-linked threat actor known as UAT-8099  that took place between late 2025 and early 2026.  The activity, discovered by Cisco Talos, has targeted vulnerable Internet Information Services (IIS) servers located across Asia, but with a specific focus on targets in Thailand and Vietnam. The scale of the campaign is currently unknown.  \"UAT-8099 uses web shells and PowerShell to execute scripts and deploy the GotoHTTP tool, granting the threat actor remote access to vulnerable IIS servers,\" security researcher Joey Chen said  in a Thursday breakdown of the campaign.  UAT-8099 was first documented  by the cybersecurity company in October 2025, detailing the threat actor's exploitation of IIS servers in India, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, and Brazil to facilitate search engine optimization (SEO) fraud. The attacks involve infecting the servers with a known malware referred to as BadIIS.   The hacking gro...",

Introduction: One view on the scattered fight against cybercrime  The growing sophistication and diversification of cybercrime have compelled law enforcement agencies worldwide to respond through increasingly coordinated and publicized actions. Yet, despite the visibility of these operations, there remains no comprehensive overview, to our knowledge, on how law enforcement is addressing cybercrime globally. Publicly available information is dispersed across agencies, jurisdictions, case-specific reporting (e.g., \"Operation Endgame\") [1] , and reporting formats, offering fragmented insights rather than a cohesive understanding of what types of crime are being targeted, what actions are taken, and who the offenders are. This results in isolated glimpses rather than a consistent global picture. Therefor...",
