      "summary": "The threat actor known as Transparent Tribe has been attributed to a fresh set of attacks targeting Indian governmental, academic, and strategic entities with a remote access trojan (RAT) that grants them persistent control over compromised hosts.  \"The campaign employs deceptive delivery techniques, including a weaponized Windows shortcut (LNK) file masquerading as a legitimate PDF document and embedded with full PDF content to evade user suspicion,\" CYFIRMA said  in a technical report.  Transparent Tribe, also called APT36, is a hacking group that's known for mounting cyber espionage campaigns against Indian organizations. Assessed to be of Indian origin, the state-sponsored adversary has been active since at least 2013.  The threat actor boasts of an ever-evolving arsenal of RATs to realize its goals. Some of the trojans put to use by Transparent Tribe in recent years include CapraRAT , Crimson RAT , ElizaRAT , and DeskRAT .  The latest set of attacks began with a s...",

      "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/the-roi-problem-in-attack-surface.html",
      "summary": "Attack Surface Management (ASM) tools promise reduced risk. What they usually deliver is more information.   Security teams deploy ASM, asset inventories grow, alerts start flowing, and dashboards fill up. There is visible activity and measurable output. But when leadership asks a simple question, \" Is this reducing incidents? \" the answer is often unclear.   This gap between effort and outcome is the core ROI problem in attack surface management, especially when ROI is measured primarily through asset counts instead of risk reduction.   The Promise vs. The Proof  Most ASM programs are built around a reasonable idea: you can't protect what you don't know exists. As a result, teams focus on discovery: domains and subdomains, IPs and cloud resources, third-party infrastructure, and transient or short-lived assets.   Over time, counts increase. Dashboards are trending upward. Coverage improves.   But none of those metrics directly answer whether the organization i...",

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a phishing campaign that involves the attackers impersonating legitimate Google-generated messages by abusing Google Cloud's Application Integration  service to distribute emails.  The activity, Check Point said, takes advantage of the trust associated with Google Cloud infrastructure to send the messages from a legitimate email address (\"noreply-application-integration@google[.]com\") so that they can bypass traditional email security filters and have a better chance of landing in users' inboxes.  \"The emails mimic routine enterprise notifications such as voicemail alerts and file access or permission requests, making them appear normal and trustworthy to recipients,\" the cybersecurity company said .  Attackers have been observed sending 9,394 phishing emails targeting approximately 3,200 customers over a 14-day period observed in December 2025, with the affected organizations located in the U.S., Asia-Pac...",

      "summary": "The first ThreatsDay Bulletin of 2026 lands on a day that already feels symbolic — new year, new breaches, new tricks. If the past twelve months taught defenders anything, it's that threat actors don't pause for holidays or resolutions. They just evolve faster. This week's round-up shows how subtle shifts in behavior, from code tweaks to job scams, are rewriting what \"cybercrime\" looks like in practice.  Across the landscape, big players are being tested, familiar threats are mutating, and smaller stories are quietly signaling bigger patterns ahead. The trend isn't about one big breach anymore; it's about many small openings that attackers exploit with precision.  The pace of exploitation, deception, and persistence hasn't slowed; it's only become more calculated. Each update in this edition highlights how the line between normal operations and compromise is getting thinner by the week.  Here's a sharp look at what's moving beneath the surface of the cybersecurity world as 2026 begin...",

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a persistent nine-month-long campaign that has targeted Internet of Things (IoT) devices and web applications to enroll them into a botnet known as RondoDox.  As of December 2025, the activity has been observed leveraging the recently disclosed React2Shell  (CVE-2025-55182, CVSS score: 10.0) flaw as an initial access vector, CloudSEK said  in an analysis.  React2Shell is the name assigned to a critical security vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js that could allow unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution on susceptible devices.  According to statistics from the Shadowserver Foundation, there are about 90,300 instances  that remain susceptible to the vulnerability as of December 31, 2025, out of which 68,400 instances  are located in the U.S., followed by Germany (4,300), France (2,800), and India (1,500).
