      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have called attention to a \"massive campaign\" that has systematically targeted cloud native environments to set up malicious infrastructure for follow-on exploitation.  The activity, observed around December 25, 2025, and described as \"worm-driven,\" leveraged exposed Docker APIs, Kubernetes clusters, Ray dashboards, and Redis servers, along with the recently disclosed React2Shell  (CVE-2025-55182, CVSS score: 10.0) vulnerability. The campaign has been attributed to a threat cluster known as TeamPCP  (aka DeadCatx3, PCPcat, PersyPCP, and ShellForce).  TeamPCP is known to be active since at least November 2025, with the first instance of Telegram activity dating back to July 30, 2025. The TeamPCP Telegram channel currently has over 700 members, where the group publishes stolen data from diverse victims across Canada, Serbia, South Korea, the U.A.E., and the U.S. Details of the threat actor were first documented  by Beelzebub in December 2025...",

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have taken the wraps off a gateway-monitoring and adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) framework dubbed DKnife  that's operated by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2019.  The framework comprises seven Linux-based implants that are designed to perform deep packet inspection, manipulate traffic, and deliver malware via routers and edge devices. Its primary targets seem to be Chinese-speaking users, an assessment based on the presence of credential harvesting phishing pages for Chinese email services, exfiltration modules for popular Chinese mobile applications like WeChat, and code references to Chinese media domains.  \"DKnife's attacks target a wide range of devices, including PCs, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices,\" Cisco Talos researcher Ashley Shen noted  in a Thursday report. \"It delivers and interacts with the ShadowPad  and DarkNimbus  backdoors by hijacking binary downloads and Android application updates....",

      "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has ordered  Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to strengthen asset lifecycle management for edge network devices and remove those that no longer receive security updates from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) over the next 12 to 18 months.  The agency said the move is to drive down technical debt and minimize the risk of compromise, as state-sponsored threat actors turn such devices as a preferred access pathway for breaking into target networks.  Edge devices is an umbrella term that encompasses load balancers, firewalls, routers, switches, wireless access points, network security appliances, Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices, software-defined networks, and other physical or virtual networking components that route network traffic and hold privileged access.   \"Persistent cyber threat actors are increasingly exploiting unsupported edge devices -- hardware and software that no longer receiv...",
