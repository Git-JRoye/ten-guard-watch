      "summary": "A new Android malware named Albiriox  has been advertised under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model to offer a \"full spectrum\" of features to facilitate on-device fraud (ODF), screen manipulation, and real-time interaction with infected devices.  The malware embeds a hard-coded list comprising over 400 applications spanning banking, financial technology, payment processors, cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallets, and trading platforms.  \"The malware leverages dropper applications distributed through social engineering lures, combined with packing techniques, to evade static detection and deliver its payload,\" Cleafy researchers Federico Valentini, Alessandro Strino, Gianluca Scotti, and Simone Mattia said .  Albiriox is said to have been first advertised as part of a limited recruitment phase in late September 2025, before shifting to a MaaS offering a month later. There is evidence to suggest that the threat actors are Russian-speaking based on their activity o...",

      "summary": "The threat actor known as Tomiris  has been attributed to attacks targeting foreign ministries, intergovernmental organizations, and government entities in Russia with an aim to establish remote access and deploy additional tools.  \"These attacks highlight a notable shift in Tomiris's tactics, namely the increased use of implants that leverage public services (e.g., Telegram and Discord) as command-and-control (C2) servers,\" Kaspersky researchers Oleg Kupreev and Artem Ushkov said  in an analysis. \"This approach likely aims to blend malicious traffic with legitimate service activity to evade detection by security tools.\"  The cybersecurity company said more than 50% of the spear-phishing emails and decoy files used in the campaign used Russian names and contained Russian text, indicating that Russian-speaking users or entities were the primary focus. The spear-phishing emails have also targeted Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan using tailored...",

      "summary": "As IT environments become increasingly distributed and organizations adopt hybrid and remote work at scale, traditional perimeter-based security models and on-premises Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions no longer suffice. IT administrators, contractors and third-party vendors now require secure access to critical systems from any location and on any device, without compromising compliance or increasing security risks. To keep up with modern demands, many organizations are turning to Remote Privileged Access Management (RPAM) for a cloud-based approach to securing privileged access that extends protection beyond on-prem environments to wherever privileged users connect.  Continue reading to learn more about RPAM, how it differs from traditional PAM and why RPAM adoption is growing across all industries.  What is RPAM?  Remote Privileged Access Management  (RPAM) allows organizations to securely monitor and manage privileged access for remote and third-party users. Unlike trad...",
