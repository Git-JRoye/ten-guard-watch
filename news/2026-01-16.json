      "summary": "A threat actor likely aligned with China has been observed targeting critical infrastructure sectors in North America since at least last year.  Cisco Talos, which is tracking the activity under the name UAT-8837 , assessed it to be a China-nexus advanced persistent threat (APT) actor with medium confidence based on tactical overlaps with other campaigns mounted by threat actors from the region.  The cybersecurity company noted that the threat actor is \"primarily tasked with obtaining initial access to high-value organizations,\" based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and post-compromise activity observed.  \"After obtaining initial access — either by successful exploitation of vulnerable servers or by using compromised credentials — UAT-8837 predominantly deploys open-source tools to harvest sensitive information such as credentials, security configurations, and domain and Active Directory (AD) information to create multiple channels of access to their v...",

      "summary": "Cisco on Thursday released  security updates for a maximum-severity security flaw impacting Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, nearly a month after the company disclosed that it had been exploited as a zero-day by a China-nexus advanced persistent threat (APT) actor codenamed UAT-9686.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-20393  (CVSS score: 10.0), is a remote command execution flaw arising as a result of insufficient validation of HTTP requests by the Spam Quarantine feature. Successful exploitation of the defect could permit an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected appliance.   However, for the attack to work, three conditions must be met -   The appliance is running a vulnerable release of Cisco AsyncOS Software  The appliance is configured with the Spam Quarantine feature  The Spam Quarantine feature is exposed to and reachable from the internet   L...",

      "summary": "A critical misconfiguration in Amazon Web Services (AWS) CodeBuild  could have allowed complete takeover of the cloud service provider's own GitHub repositories, including its AWS JavaScript SDK, putting every AWS environment at risk.  The vulnerability has been codenamed CodeBreach  by cloud security company Wiz. The issue was fixed by AWS in September 2025 following responsible disclosure on August 25, 2025.  \"By exploiting CodeBreach, attackers could have injected malicious code to launch a platform-wide compromise, potentially affecting not just the countless applications depending on the SDK, but the Console itself, threatening every AWS account,\" researchers Yuval Avrahami and Nir Ohfeld said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  The flaw, Wiz noted, is the result of a weakness in the continuous integration (CI) pipelines that could have enabled unauthenticated attackers to breach the build environment, leak privileged credentials like GitHub admin tokens, and...",

      "summary": "A maximum-severity security flaw in a WordPress plugin called Modular DS  has come under active exploitation in the wild, according to Patchstack.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-23550 (CVSS score: 10.0), has been described as a case of unauthenticated privilege escalation impacting all versions of the plugin prior to and including 2.5.1. It has been patched in version 2.5.2 . The plugin has more than 40,000 active installs.  \"In versions 2.5.1 and below, the plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation, due to a combination of factors including direct route selection, bypassing of authentication mechanisms, and auto-login as admin,\" Patchstack said .  The problem is rooted in its routing mechanism, which is designed to put certain sensitive routes behind an authentication barrier. The plugin exposes its routes under the \"/api/modular-connector/\" prefix.   However, it has been found that this security layer can be bypassed every time the \"direct reques...",

It was fixed in version 8.3.2. JFrog's analysis of the flaw has revealed  that the vulnerability is triggered when using the new Redis 8.2 XACKDEL command, which was introduced to simplify and optimize stream cleanup. Specifically, it resides in the implementation of xackdelCommand(), a function responsible for parsing and processing the list of stream IDs supplied by the user. \"The core ...",
