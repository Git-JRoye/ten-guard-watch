      "summary": "Threat actors with ties to Iran engaged in cyber warfare as part of efforts to facilitate and enhance physical, real-world attacks, a trend that Amazon has called cyber-enabled kinetic targeting.  The development is a sign that the lines between state-sponsored cyber attacks and kinetic warfare are increasingly blurring, necessitating the need for a new category of warfare, the tech giant's threat intelligence team said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  While traditional cybersecurity frameworks have treated digital and physical threats as separate domains, CJ Moses, CISO of Amazon Integrated Security, said these delineations are artificial and that nation-state threat actors are engaging in cyber reconnaissance activity to enable kinetic targeting.  \"These aren't just cyber attacks that happen to cause physical damage; they are coordinated campaigns where digital operations are specifically designed to support physical military objectives,\" Moses added.   As an...",

      "summary": "Threat actors are leveraging bogus installers masquerading as popular software to trick users into installing malware as part of a global malvertising campaign dubbed TamperedChef .  The end goal of the attacks is to establish persistence and deliver JavaScript malware that facilitates remote access and control, per a new report from Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU). The campaign , per the Singapore-headquartered company, is still ongoing, with new artifacts being detected and associated infrastructure remaining active.  \"The operator(s) rely on social engineering by using everyday application names, malvertising, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and abused digital certificates that aim to increase user trust and evade security detection,\" researchers Darrel Virtusio and Jozsef Gegeny said.   TamperedChef is the name assigned to a long-running campaign that has leveraged  seemingly legitimate installers for various utilities to distribute an information stealer malware of...",

      "summary": "A recently disclosed security flaw impacting 7-Zip has come under active exploitation in the wild, according to an advisory issued by the U.K. NHS England Digital on Tuesday.  The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-11001  (CVSS score: 7.0), which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. It has been addressed in 7-Zip version 25.00 released  in July 2025.  \"The specific flaw exists within the handling of symbolic links in ZIP files. Crafted data in a ZIP file can cause the process to traverse to unintended directories,\" Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) said in an alert released last month. \"An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of a service account.\"  Ryota Shiga of GMO Flatt Security Inc., along with the company's artificial intelligence (AI)-powered AppSec Auditor Takumi , has been credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability.    It's worth noting that 7-Zip 25.00 also resolves anoth...",

      "summary": "A newly discovered campaign has compromised tens of thousands of outdated or end-of-life (EoL) ASUS routers worldwide, predominantly in Taiwan, the U.S., and Russia, to rope them into a massive network.  The router hijacking activity has been codenamed Operation WrtHug  by SecurityScorecard's STRIKE team. Southeast Asia and European countries are some of the other regions where infections have been recorded. Over the past six months, more than 50,000 unique IP addresses belonging to these compromised devices around the globe have been identified.  The attacks likely involve the exploitation of six known security flaws in end-of-life ASUS WRT routers to take control of susceptible devices. All the infected routers have been found to share a unique self-signed TLS certificate with an expiration date set for 100 years from April 2022.  SecurityScorecard said 99% of the services presenting the certificate are ASUS AiCloud, a proprietary service designed to enable access to local stora...",

      "summary": "The challenge facing security leaders is monumental: Securing environments where failure is not an option. Reliance on traditional security postures, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)  to chase threats after they have already entered the network, is fundamentally risky and contributes significantly to the half-trillion-dollar annual cost of cybercrime.  Zero Trust fundamentally shifts this approach, transitioning from reacting to symptoms to proactively solving the underlying problem. Application Control, the ability to rigorously define what software is allowed to execute, is the foundation of this strategy. However, even once an application is trusted, it can be misused. This is where ThreatLocker Ringfencing™, or granular application containment , becomes indispensable, enforcing the ultimate standard of least privilege on all authorized applications.
