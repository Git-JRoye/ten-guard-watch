      "summary": "The Black Lotus Labs team at Lumen Technologies said  it null-routed traffic to more than 550 command-and-control (C2) nodes associated with the AISURU/Kimwolf botnet since early October 2025.  AISURU and its Android counterpart, Kimwolf, have emerged as some of the biggest botnets in recent times, capable of directing enslaved devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and relay malicious traffic for residential proxy services .  Details about Kimwolf emerged last month  when QiAnXin XLab published an exhaustive analysis of the malware, which turns compromised devices – mostly unsanctioned Android TV streaming devices – into a residential proxy by delivering a software development kit (SDK) called ByteConnect either directly or through sketchy apps that come pre-installed on them.  The net result is that the botnet has expanded to infect more than 2 million Android devices  with an exposed Android Debug Bridge (ADB) service by tunneling through residentia...",

      "summary": "Not long ago, AI agents were harmless. They wrote snippets of code. They answered questions. They helped individuals move a little faster.  Then organizations got ambitious.  Instead of personal copilots, companies started deploying shared organizational AI agents - agents embedded into HR, IT, engineering, customer support, and operations. Agents that don't just suggest, but act. Agents that touch real systems, change real configurations, and move real data:   An HR agent who provisions and deprovisions access across IAM, SaaS apps, VPNs, and cloud platforms.  A change management agent that approves requests, updates production configs, logs actions in ServiceNow, and updates Confluence.  A support agent that pulls customer data from CRM, checks billing status, triggers backend fixes, and updates tickets automatically.   These agents warrant deliberate control and oversight. They're now part of our operational infrastructure. And to make them useful, we made them powerful ...",
