      "summary": "Security vulnerabilities were uncovered in the popular open-source artificial intelligence (AI) framework Chainlit  that could allow attackers to steal sensitive data, which may allow for lateral movement within a susceptible organization.  Zafran Security said  the high-severity flaws, collectively dubbed ChainLeak , could be abused to leak cloud environment API keys and steal sensitive files, or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks against servers hosting AI applications.  Chainlit  is a framework for creating conversational chatbots. According to statistics shared by the Python Software Foundation, the package has been downloaded over 220,000 times  over the past week. It has attracted a total of 7.3 million downloads to date.   Details of the two vulnerabilities are as follows -   CVE-2026-22218  (CVSS score: 7.1) - An arbitrary file read vulnerability in the \"/project/element\" update flow that allows an authenticated attacker to access the contents of any ...",

      "summary": "The recently discovered sophisticated Linux malware framework known as VoidLink  is assessed to have been developed by a single person with assistance from an artificial intelligence (AI) model.  That's according to new findings  from Check Point Research, which identified operational security blunders by malware's author that provided clues to its developmental origins. The latest insight makes VoidLink one of the first instances of an advanced malware largely generated using AI.  \"These materials provide clear evidence that the malware was produced predominantly through AI-driven development, reaching a first functional implant in under a week,\" the cybersecurity company said, adding it reached more than 88,000 lines of code by early December 2025.  VoidLink, first publicly documented  last week, is a feature-rich malware framework written in Zig that's specifically designed for long-term, stealthy access to Linux-based cloud environments.

      "summary": "A security vulnerability has been disclosed in the popular binary-parser npm library  that, if successfully exploited, could result in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-1245  (CVSS score: N/A), affects all versions of the module prior to version 2.3.0 , which addresses the issue. Patches for the flaw were released on November 26, 2025.  Binary-parser is a widely used parser builder for JavaScript that allows developers to parse binary data. It supports a wide range of common data types, including integers, floating-point values, strings, and arrays. The package attracts approximately 13,000 downloads on a weekly basis.  According to an advisory  released by the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC), the vulnerability has to do with a lack of sanitization  of user-supplied values, such as parser field names and encoding parameters, when the JavaScript parser code is dynamically generated at runtime using the \"Function\" constructor.   ...",

First disclosed  by OpenSourceMalware last month, the attack essentially involves instructing prospective targets to clone a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and launch the project in VS Code as part of a supposed job assessment.
