      "summary": "Over 30 security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in various artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that combine prompt injection primitives  with legitimate features to achieve data exfiltration and remote code execution.  The security shortcomings have been collectively named IDEsaster  by security researcher Ari Marzouk (MaccariTA). They affect popular IDEs and extensions such as Cursor, Windsurf, Kiro.dev, GitHub Copilot, Zed.dev, Roo Code, Junie, and Cline, among others. Of these, 24 have been assigned CVE identifiers.  \"I think the fact that multiple universal attack chains affected each and every AI IDE tested is the most surprising finding of this research,\" Marzouk told The Hacker News.  \"All AI IDEs (and coding assistants that integrate with them) effectively ignore the base software (IDE) in their threat model. They treat their features as inherently safe because they've been there for years. However, once you add A...",

      "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday formally added  a critical security flaw impacting React Server Components (RSC) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ( KEV ) catalog following reports of active exploitation in the wild.  The vulnerability, CVE-2025-55182  (CVSS score: 10.0), relates to a case of remote code execution that could be triggered by an unauthenticated attacker without requiring any special setup. It's also tracked as React2Shell.  \"Meta React Server Components contains a remote code execution vulnerability that could allow unauthenticated remote code execution by exploiting a flaw in how React decodes payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints,\" CISA said in an advisory.  The problem stems from insecure deserialization  in the library's Flight protocol, which React uses to communicate between a server and client. As a result, it leads to a scenario where an unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbi...",

      "summary": "A new agentic browser attack targeting Perplexity's Comet browser  that's capable of turning a seemingly innocuous email into a destructive action that wipes a user's entire Google Drive contents, findings from Straiker STAR Labs show.  The zero-click Google Drive Wiper technique hinges on connecting the browser to services like Gmail and Google Drive to automate routine tasks by granting them access to read emails, as well as browse files and folders, and perform actions like moving, renaming, or deleting content.  For instance, a prompt issued by a benign user might look like this: \"Please check my email and complete all my recent organization tasks.\" This will cause the browser agent to search the inbox for relevant messages and perform the necessary actions.   \"This behavior reflects excessive agency in LLM-powered assistants where the LLM performs actions that go far beyond the user's explicit request,\" security researcher Amanda Rousseau said  in ...",
