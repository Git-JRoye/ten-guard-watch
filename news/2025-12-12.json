      "summary": "The React team has released  fixes for two new types of flaws in React Server Components (RSC) that, if successfully exploited, could result in denial-of-service (DoS) or source code exposure.  The team said the issues were found by the security community while attempting to exploit the patches released for CVE-2025-55182 (CVSS score: 10.0), a critical bug in RSC that has since been weaponized in the wild .  The three vulnerabilities are listed below -   CVE-2025-55184  (CVSS score: 7.5) - A pre-authentication denial of service vulnerability arising from unsafe deserialization of payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints, triggering an infinite loop that hangs the server process and may prevent future HTTP requests from being served  CVE-2025-67779  (CVSS score: 7.5) - An incomplete fix for CVE-2025-55184 that has the same impact  CVE-2025-55183  (CVSS score: 5.3) - An information leak vulnerability that may cause a specifically crafted HTTP request sent to a vulnerable...",

      "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has urged  federal agencies to patch the recent React2Shell  vulnerability by December 12, 2025, amid reports of widespread exploitation.  The critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-55182  (CVSS score: 10.0), affects the React Server Components (RSC) Flight protocol. The underlying cause of the issue is an unsafe deserialization that allows an attacker to inject malicious logic that the server executes in a privileged context. It also affects other frameworks, including Next.js, Waku, Vite, React Router, and RedwoodSDK.  \"A single, specially crafted HTTP request is sufficient; there is no authentication requirement, user interaction, or elevated permissions involved,\" Cloudforce One, Cloudflare's threat intelligence team, said . \"Once successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary, privileged JavaScript on the affected server.\"  Since its public disclosure on December 3, 2025, the shortcoming...",

FINALDRAFT is attributed to a threat cluster known as REF7707 (aka CL-STA-0049, Earth Alux, and Jewelbug).  \"One of the malware's primary features is centered around shipping data back and forth from the victim endpoint using the Google Drive API,\" Daniel Stepanic, principal security researcher at Elastic Security Labs, said.   \"This feature ends up providing a channel for data theft and payload staging that is difficult for detection.

      "summary": "As enterprises refine their strategies for handling Non-Human Identities (NHIs), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has become a powerful tool for streamlining operations and enhancing security. However, since RPA bots have varying levels of access to sensitive information, enterprises must be prepared to mitigate a variety of challenges. In large organizations, bots are starting to outnumber human employees, and without proper identity lifecycle management, these bots increase security risks. RPA impacts Identity and Access Management (IAM) by managing bot identities, enforcing least-privilege access and ensuring auditability across all accounts.  Continue reading to learn more about RPA, its challenges with IAM and best practices organizations should follow to secure RPA within IAM.  What is Robotic Process Automation (RPA)?
