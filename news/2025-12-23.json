      "summary": "The U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) on Monday announced the seizure of a web domain and database that it said was used to further a criminal scheme designed to target and defraud Americans by means of bank account takeover fraud.  The domain in question, web3adspanels[.]org, was used as a backend web panel to host and manipulate illegally harvested bank login credentials. Users to the website are now greeted by a seizure banner that says the domain was taken down in an international law enforcement operation led by authorities from the U.S. and Estonia.  \"The criminal group perpetrating the bank account takeover fraud delivered fraudulent advertisements through search engines, including Google and Bing,\" the DoJ said . \"These fraudulent advertisements imitate the sponsored search engine advertisements used by legitimate banking entities.\"  The ads served as a conduit to redirect unsuspecting users to fake bank websites operated by the threat actors, who harvested log...",

      "summary": "The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Monday announced  a ban on all drones and critical components made in a foreign country, citing national security concerns.  To that end, the agency has added to its Covered List  Uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) and UAS critical components produced in a foreign country, and all communications and video surveillance equipment and services pursuant to the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ). This move will keep China-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel Robotics out of the U.S. market.  The FCC said that while drones offer the potential to enhance public safety and innovation, criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists can weaponize them to present serious threats to the U.S.   It also noted that a further review by an Executive Branch interagency body with appropriate national security expertise that was convened by the White House led to a \"specific determination\" that UAS and UAS critical compon...",

      "summary": "Cyber threats last week showed how attackers no longer need big hacks to cause big damage. They're going after the everyday tools we trust most — firewalls, browser add-ons, and even smart TVs — turning small cracks into serious breaches.  The real danger now isn't just one major attack, but hundreds of quiet ones using the software and devices already inside our networks. Each trusted system can become an entry point if it's left unpatched or overlooked.  Here's a clear look at the week's biggest risks, from exploited network flaws to new global campaigns and fast-moving vulnerabilities.  ⚡ Threat of the Week  Flaws in Multiple Network Security Products Come Under Attack — Over the past week, Fortinet , SonicWall , Cisco , and WatchGuard  said vulnerabilities in their products have been exploited by threat actors in real-world attacks.

      "summary": "As the internet becomes an essential part of daily life, its environmental footprint continues to grow.   Data centers, constant connectivity, and resource-heavy browsing habits all contribute to energy consumption and digital waste. While individual users may not see this impact directly, the collective effect of everyday browsing is significant.  Choosing a  browser designed with sustainability in mind  is one practical way to reduce that impact, without changing how you work online.  This article explains what eco-friendly browsing means, why it matters, and how a green browser like Wave Browser  pairs a modern, secure browsing experience with a mission to help protect our ocean through verified cleanup efforts.  Why Eco-Friendly Browsing Matters  Most people think of environmental impact in terms of transportation, food, or physical products. Digital activity is often overlooked.
