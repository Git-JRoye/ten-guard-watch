      "summary": "Trust Wallet on Tuesday revealed that the second iteration of the Shai-Hulud  (aka Sha1-Hulud) supply chain outbreak in November 2025 was likely responsible for the hack of its Google Chrome extension, ultimately resulting in the theft of approximately $8.5 million in assets.  \"Our Developer GitHub secrets were exposed in the attack, which gave the attacker access to our browser extension source code and the Chrome Web Store (CWS) API key,\" the company said  in a post-mortem published Tuesday.  \"The attacker obtained full CWS API access via the leaked key, allowing builds to be uploaded directly without Trust Wallet's standard release process, which requires internal approval/manual review.\"   Subsequently, the attacker is said to have registered the domain \"metrics-trustwallet[.]com\" and pushed a trojanized version of the extension with a backdoor that's capable of harvesting users' wallet mnemonic phrases to the sub-domain \"api.metrics-...",

      "summary": "The threat actor behind two malicious browser extension campaigns, ShadyPanda  and GhostPoster , has been attributed to a third attack campaign codenamed DarkSpectre that has impacted 2.2 million users of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox.  The activity is assessed  to be the work of a Chinese threat actor that Koi Security is tracking under the moniker DarkSpectre . In all, the campaigns have collectively affected over 8.8 million users spanning a period of more than seven years.  ShadyPanda was first unmasked by the cybersecurity company earlier this month as targeting all three browser users to facilitate data theft, search query hijacking, and affiliate fraud. It has been found to affect 5.6 million users, including 1.3 newly identified victims stemming from over 100 extensions flagged as connected to the same cluster.  This also includes an Edge add-on named \"New Tab - Customized Dashboard\" that features a logic bomb that waits for three days prior to t...",

      "summary": "The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) has issued  a bulletin warning of a maximum-severity security flaw in SmarterTools SmarterMail  email software that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution.  The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-52691 , carries a CVSS score of 10.0. It relates to a case of arbitrary file upload that could enable code execution without requiring any authentication.  \"Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to any location on the mail server, potentially enabling remote code execution,\" CSA said.  Vulnerabilities of this kind allow the upload of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within an application's environment. This could pave the way for code execution if the uploaded file is interpreted and executed as code, as is the case with PHP files.   In a hypothetical attack scenario, a bad actor could weaponize this vulnerability to place malici...",
