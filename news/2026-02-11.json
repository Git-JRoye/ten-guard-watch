      "summary": "The North Korea-linked threat actor known as UNC1069  has been observed targeting the cryptocurrency sector to steal sensitive data from Windows and macOS systems with the ultimate goal of facilitating financial theft.  \"The intrusion relied on a social engineering scheme involving a compromised Telegram account, a fake Zoom meeting, a ClickFix  infection vector, and reported usage of AI-generated video to deceive the victim,\" Google Mandiant researchers Ross Inman and Adrian Hernandez said .  UNC1069, assessed  to be active since at least April 2018, has a history of conducting social engineering campaigns for financial gain using fake meeting invites and posing as investors from reputable companies on Telegram. It's also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the monikers CryptoCore and MASAN .   In a report published last November, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) pointed out  the threat actor's use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) t...",

      "summary": "The information technology (IT) workers associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are now applying to remote positions using real LinkedIn accounts of individuals they're impersonating, marking a new escalation of the fraudulent scheme.  \"These profiles often have verified workplace emails and identity badges, which DPRK operatives hope will make their fraudulent applications appear legitimate,\" Security Alliance (SEAL) said  in a series of posts on X.  The IT worker threat  is a long-running operation  mounted by North Korea in which operatives from the country pose as remote workers to secure jobs in Western companies and elsewhere under stolen or fabricated identities. The threat is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community as Jasper Sleet, PurpleDelta, and Wagemole.  The end goal of these efforts is two-pronged: to generate a steady revenue stream to fund the nation's weapons programs, conduct espionage by stealing sensitive...",

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of an emergent ransomware family dubbed Reynolds  that comes embedded with a built-in bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) component for defense evasion purposes within the ransomware payload itself.  BYOVD refers to an adversarial technique  that abuses legitimate but flawed driver software to escalate privileges and disable Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions so that malicious activities go unnoticed. The strategy has been adopted  by many ransomware groups  over the years.  \"Normally, the BYOVD defense evasion component of an attack would involve a distinct tool that would be deployed on the system prior to the ransomware payload in order to disable security software,\" the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. \"However, in this attack, the vulnerable driver (an NsecSoft NSecKrnl driver) was bundled with the ransomware itself.\"  Broadcom's ...",

      "summary": "Are ransomware and encryption still the defining signals of modern cyberattacks, or has the industry been too fixated on noise while missing a more dangerous shift happening quietly all around them?  According to Picus Labs’ new Red Report 2026,  which analyzed over 1.1 million malicious files and mapped 15.5 million adversarial actions observed across 2025, attackers are no longer optimizing for disruption. Instead, their goal is now long-term, invisible access.  To be clear, ransomware isn’t going anywhere, and adversaries continue to innovate. But the data shows a clear strategic pivot away from loud, destructive attacks toward techniques designed to evade detection, persist inside environments, and quietly exploit identity and trusted infrastructure. Rather than breaking in and burning systems down, today’s attackers increasingly behave like Digital Parasites. They live inside the host, feed on credentials and services, and remain undetected for as long as possible.  Public attent...",

This investment came from the well-known investment firm Hillhouse Capital, bringing ZAST.AI's total funding close to $10 million. This marks a recognition from leading capital markets of a new solution: ending the era of high false positive rates in security tools and making every alert genuinely actionable.  In 2025, ZAST.AI discovered hundreds of zero-day vulnerabilities across dozens of popular open-source projects. These findings were submitted through authoritative vulnerability platforms like VulDB, successfully resulting in 119 CVE assignments . These are not laboratory targets, but production-grade code supporting global businesses. Affected well-known projects include widely used components and frameworks such as Microsoft Azure SDK, Apache Struts XWork, Alibaba Nacos, Langfuse, Koa, node-formidable, and others.
