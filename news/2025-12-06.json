      "summary": "A new agentic browser attack targeting Perplexity's Comet browser  that's capable of turning a seemingly innocuous email into a destructive action that wipes a user's entire Google Drive contents, findings from Straiker STAR Labs show.  The zero-click Google Drive Wiper technique hinges on connecting the browser to services like Gmail and Google Drive to automate routine tasks by granting them access to read emails, as well as browse files and folders, and perform actions like moving, renaming, or deleting content.  For instance, a prompt issued by a benign user might look like this: \"Please check my email and complete all my recent organization tasks.\" This will cause the browser agent to search the inbox for relevant messages and perform the necessary actions.   \"This behavior reflects excessive agency in LLM-powered assistants where the LLM performs actions that go far beyond the user's explicit request,\" security researcher Amanda Rousseau said  in ...",
