      "summary": "Google's Mandiant Threat Defense on Monday said it discovered  n-day exploitation of a now-patched security flaw in Gladinet's Triofox file-sharing and remote access platform.  The critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-12480  (CVSS score: 9.1), allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access the configuration pages, resulting in the upload and execution of arbitrary payloads.   The tech giant said it observed a threat cluster tracked as UNC6485 weaponizing the flaw as far back as August 24, 2025, nearly a month after Gladinet released patches for the flaw in version 16.7.10368.56560 . It's worth noting that CVE-2025-12480 is the third flaw in Triofox that has come under active exploitation this year alone, after CVE-2025-30406  and CVE-2025-11371 .   \"Added protection for the initial configuration pages,\" according to release notes for the software. \"These pages can no longer be accessed after Triofox has been set up.\"  Mandiant said the th...",

      "summary": "The North Korea-affiliated threat actor known as Konni  (aka Earth Imp, Opal Sleet, Osmium, TA406, and Vedalia) has been attributed to a new set of attacks targeting both Android and Windows devices for data theft and remote control.  \"Attackers impersonated psychological counselors and North Korean human rights activists, distributing malware disguised as stress-relief programs,\" the Genians Security Center (GSC) said  in a technical report.  What's notable about the attacks targeting Android devices is also the destructive ability of the threat actors to exploit Google's asset tracking services Find Hub (formerly Find My Device) to remotely reset victim devices, thereby leading to the unauthorized deletion of personal data. The activity was detected in early September 2025.  The development marks the first time the hacking group  has weaponized legitimate management functions to remotely reset mobile devices. The activity is also preceded by an attack chain in whic...",

      "summary": "Cyber threats didn't slow down last week—and attackers are getting smarter. We're seeing malware hidden in virtual machines, side-channel leaks exposing AI chats, and spyware quietly targeting Android devices in the wild.  But that's just the surface. From sleeper logic bombs to a fresh alliance between major threat groups, this week's roundup highlights a clear shift: cybercrime is evolving fast, and the lines between technical stealth and strategic coordination are blurring.  It's worth your time. Every story here is about real risks that your team needs to know about right now.

      "summary": "According to the new Browser Security Report 2025 , security leaders are discovering that most identity, SaaS, and AI-related risks converge in a single place, the user's browser. Yet traditional controls like DLP, EDR, and SSE still operate one layer too low.  What's emerging isn't just a blindspot. It's a parallel threat surface: unmanaged extensions acting like supply chain implants, GenAI tools accessed through personal accounts, sensitive data copy/pasted directly into prompt fields, and sessions that bypass SSO altogether.  This article unpacks the key findings from the report and what they reveal about the shifting locus of control in enterprise security.  GenAI Is Now the Top Data Exfiltration Channel  The rise of GenAI in enterprise workflows has created a massive governance gap. Nearly half of employees use GenAI tools, but most do so through unmanaged accounts, outside of IT visibility.  Key stats from the report:   77%  of employees paste data into GenAI prompts  82%  of...",
