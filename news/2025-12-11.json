      "summary": "Google on Wednesday shipped security updates for its Chrome browser to address three security flaws, including one it said has come under active exploitation in the wild.  The vulnerability, rated high in severity, is being tracked under the Chromium issue tracker ID \" 466192044 .\" Unlike other disclosures, Google has opted to keep information about the CVE identifier, the affected component, and the nature of the flaw under wraps.  \"Google is aware that an exploit for 466192044 exists in the wild,\" the company noted , adding that more details are \"under coordination.\"  Naturally, the tech giant has also not disclosed any specifics on the identity of the threat actor behind the attacks, who may have been targeted, or the scale of such efforts.  This is typically done so as to ensure that a majority of the users have applied the fixes and to prevent other bad actors from reverse engineering the patch and developing their own exploits.

      "summary": "Huntress is warning of a new actively exploited vulnerability in Gladinet's CentreStack and Triofox products stemming from the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys that have affected nine organizations so far.  \"Threat actors can potentially abuse this as a way to access the web.config file, opening the door for deserialization and remote code execution,\" security researcher Bryan Masters said .  The use of hard-coded cryptographic keys could allow threat actors to decrypt or forge access tickets, enabling them to access sensitive files like web.config that can be exploited to achieve ViewState deserialization and remote code execution, the cybersecurity company added.  At its core, the issue is rooted in a function named \"GenerateSecKey()\" present in \"GladCtrl64.dll\" that's used to generate the cryptographic keys necessary to encrypt access tickets containing authorization data (i.e., Username and Password) and enable access to the file system as...",

      "summary": "React2Shell  continues  to witness heavy exploitation, with threat actors leveraging the maximum-severity security flaw in React Server Components (RSC) to deliver cryptocurrency miners and an array of previously undocumented malware families, according to new findings  from Huntress.  This includes a Linux backdoor called PeerBlight, a reverse proxy tunnel named CowTunnel, and a Go-based post-exploitation implant referred to as ZinFoq.  The cybersecurity company said it has observed attackers targeting numerous organizations via CVE-2025-55182, a critical security vulnerability in RSC that allows unauthenticated remote code execution. As of December 8, 2025, these efforts have been aimed at a wide range of sectors, but prominently the construction and entertainment industries.  The first recorded exploitation attempt on a Windows endpoint by Huntress dates back to December 4, 2025, when an unknown threat actor exploited a vulnerable instance of Next.js to drop a shell script, follo...",

      "summary": "New research has uncovered exploitation primitives in the .NET Framework that could be leveraged against enterprise-grade applications to achieve remote code execution.  WatchTowr Labs, which has codenamed the \"invalid cast vulnerability\" SOAPwn , said  the issue impacts Barracuda Service Center RMM, Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM), and Umbraco 8. But the number of affected vendors is likely to be longer given the widespread use of .NET.  The findings were presented today  by watchTowr security researcher Piotr Bazydlo at the Black Hat Europe security conference, which is being held in London.  SOAPwn essentially allows attackers to abuse Web Services Description Language (WSDL) imports and HTTP client proxies to execute arbitrary code in products built on the foundations of .NET due to errors in the way they handle Simple Object Access Protocol ( SOAP ) messages.  \"It is usually abusable through SOAP clients, especially if they are dynamically created from the attacker-c...",
