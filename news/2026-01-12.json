      "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/researchers-uncover-service-providers.html",
      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on two service providers that supply online criminal networks with the necessary tools and infrastructure to fuel the pig butchering-as-a-service (PBaaS) economy.  At least since 2016, Chinese-speaking criminal groups have erected  industrial-scale scam centers across Southeast Asia, creating special economic zones that are devoted  to fraudulent investment and impersonation operations.  These compounds are host to thousands of people who are lured  with the promise of high-paying jobs, only to have their passports and be forced to conduct scams under the threat of violence. INTERPOL has characterized  these networks as human trafficking-fuelled fraud on an industrial scale.  One of the crucial drivers of the pig butchering (aka romance baiting) scams is service providers who supply the networks with all the tools to run and manage social engineering operations, as well as swiftly launder stolen funds and cryptocurrencies and move ill-gotten p...",

      "summary": "The Iranian threat actor known as MuddyWater  has been attributed to a spear-phishing campaign targeting diplomatic, maritime, financial, and telecom entities in the Middle East with a Rust-based implant codenamed RustyWater .  \"The campaign uses icon spoofing and malicious Word documents to deliver Rust based implants capable of asynchronous C2, anti-analysis, registry persistence, and modular post-compromise capability expansion,\" CloudSEK resetter Prajwal Awasthi said  in a report published this week.  The latest development reflects continued evolution of MuddyWater's tradecraft, which has gradually-but-steadily reduced its reliance  on legitimate remote access software as a post-exploitation tool in favor of a diverse custom malware arsenal comprising tools like Phoenix, UDPGangster , BugSleep (aka MuddyRot), and MuddyViper .  Also tracked as Mango Sandstorm, Static Kitten, and TA450, the hacking group is assessed to be affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelli...",

      "summary": "Europol on Friday announced the arrest of 34 individuals in Spain who are alleged to be part of an international criminal organization called Black Axe .  As part of an operation conducted by the Spanish National Police, in coordination with the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office and Europol, 28 arrests were made in Seville, along with three others in Madrid, two in Málaga, and one in Barcelona.  \"The criminal network is known for its involvement in a wide range of criminal activities, including cyber-enabled fraud, drug trafficking, human trafficking and prostitution, kidnapping, armed robbery and fraudulent spiritual practices,\" Europol said  in a statement.

      "summary": "Chinese-speaking threat actors are suspected to have leveraged a compromised SonicWall VPN appliance as an initial access vector to deploy a VMware ESXi exploit that may have been developed as far back as February 2024.  Cybersecurity firm Huntress, which observed  the activity in December 2025 and stopped it before it could progress to the final stage, said it may have resulted in a ransomware attack.  Most notably, the attack is believed to have exploited three VMware vulnerabilities  that were disclosed as zero-days by Broadcom in March 2025: CVE-2025-22224 (CVSS score: 9.3), CVE-2025-22225 (CVSS score: 8.2), and CVE-2025-22226 (CVSS score: 7.1). Successful exploitation of the issue could permit a malicious actor with admin privileges to leak memory from the Virtual Machine Executable (VMX) process or execute code as the VMX process.  That same month, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the flaw to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog...",
