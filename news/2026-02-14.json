      "summary": "A previously undocumented threat actor has been attributed to attacks targeting Ukrainian organizations with malware known as CANFAIL .  Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) described the hack group as possibly affiliated with Russian intelligence services. The threat actor is assessed to have targeted defense, military, government, and energy organizations within the Ukrainian regional and national governments.  However, the group has also exhibited growing interest in aerospace organizations, manufacturing companies with military and drone ties, nuclear and chemical research organizations, and international organizations involved in conflict monitoring and humanitarian aid in Ukraine, GTIG added.   \"Despite being less sophisticated and resourced than other Russian threat groups, this actor recently began to overcome some technical limitations using LLMs [large language models],\" GTIG said .   \"Through prompting, they conduct reconnaissance, create lures for social ...",

      "summary": "Several state-sponsored actors, hacktivist entities, and criminal groups from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia have trained their sights on the defense industrial base (DIB) sector, according to findings from Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG).  The tech giant's threat intelligence division said the adversarial targeting of the sector is centered around four key themes: striking defense entities deploying technologies on the battlefield in the Russia-Ukraine War, directly approaching employees and exploitation of the hiring process by North Korean and Iranian actors, use of edge devices and appliances as initial access pathways for China-nexus groups, and supply chain risk stemming from the breach of the manufacturing sector.  \"Many of the chief state-sponsors of cyber espionage and hacktivist actors have shown an interest in autonomous vehicles and drones, as these platforms play an increasing role in modern warfare,\" GTIG said . \"Further, the 'evasion...",

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious Google Chrome extension that's designed to steal data associated with Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager.  The extension, named CL Suite by @CLMasters (ID: jkphinfhmfkckkcnifhjiplhfoiefffl), is marketed as a way to scrape Meta Business Suite data, remove verification pop-ups, and generate two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The extension has 33 users as of writing. It was first uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on March 1, 2025.  However, the browser add-on also exfiltrates TOTP codes for Facebook and Meta Business accounts, Business Manager contact lists, and analytics data to infrastructure controlled by the threat actor, Socket said.  \"The extension requests broad access to meta.com and facebook.com and claims in its privacy policy that 2FA secrets and Business Manager data remain local,\" security researcher Kirill Boychenko said .  \"In practice, the code transmits TOTP seeds and current one-t...",

      "summary": "In December 2025, in response to the Sha1-Hulud incident, npm completed a major authentication overhaul  intended to reduce supply-chain attacks. While the overhaul is a solid step forward, the changes don’t make npm projects immune from supply-chain attacks. npm is still susceptible to malware attacks – here’s what you need to know for a safer Node community.  Let’s start with the original problem  Historically, npm relied on classic tokens: long-lived, broadly scoped credentials that could persist indefinitely. If stolen, attackers could directly publish malicious versions to the author’s packages (no publicly verifiable source code needed). This made npm a prime vector for supply-chain attacks. Over time, numerous real-world incidents demonstrated this point. Shai-Hulud, Sha1-Hulud, and chalk/debug are examples of recent, notable attacks.   npm’s solution  To address this, npm made the following changes:   npm revoked all classic tokens and defaulted to session-based tokens instead...",
