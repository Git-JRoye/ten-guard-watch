Shanmugam, accused  UNC3886 of striking high-value strategic threat targets. UNC3886 is assessed to be active since at least 2022, targeting edge devices and virtualization technologies to obtain initial access.

As companies connect AI, cloud apps, developer tools, and communication systems, attackers are following those same paths.  A clear pattern this week: attackers are abusing trust. Trusted updates, trusted marketplaces, trusted apps, even trusted AI workflows. Instead of breaking security controls head-on, they’re slipping into places that already have access.

      "summary": "Why do SOC teams keep burning out and missing SLAs even after spending big on security tools? Routine triage piles up, senior specialists get dragged into basic validation, and MTTR climbs, while stealthy threats still find room to slip through. Top CISOs have realized the solution isn’t hiring more people or stacking yet another tool onto the workflow, but giving their teams faster, clearer behavior evidence from the start.  Here’s how they’re breaking the cycle and speeding up response without extra hiring.  Starting with Sandbox-First Investigation to Cut MTTR at the Source  The fastest way to reduce MTTR is to remove the delays baked into investigations. Static verdicts and fragmented workflows force analysts to guess, escalate, and re-check the same alerts, which drives burnout and slows containment.  That’s why top CISOs are making sandbox execution the first step .  With an interactive sandbox like ANY.RUN , teams can detonate suspicious files and links in an isolated environme...",
