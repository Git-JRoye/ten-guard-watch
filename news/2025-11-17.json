      "summary": "Google has disclosed that the company's continued adoption of the Rust programming language in Android has resulted in the number of memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time.  \"We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android's C and C++ code. But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery,\" Google's Jeff Vander Stoep said . \"With Rust changes having a 4x lower rollback rate and spending 25% less time in code review, the safer path is now also the faster one.\"  The development comes a little over a year after the tech giant disclosed  that its transition to Rust led to a decline in memory safety vulnerabilities from 223 in 2019 to less than 50 in 2024.   The company pointed out that Rust code requires fewer revisions, necessitating about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts, and has contributed to a d...",

      "summary": "The botnet malware known as RondoDox  has been observed targeting unpatched XWiki instances against a critical security flaw that could allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution.  The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-24893 (CVSS score: 9.8), an eval injection bug  that could allow any guest user to perform arbitrary remote code execution through a request to the \"/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch\" endpoint. It was patched  by the maintainers in XWiki 15.10.11, 16.4.1, and 16.5.0RC1 in late February 2025.  While there was evidence that the shortcoming had been exploited in the wild since at least March, it wasn't until late October, when VulnCheck disclosed  it had observed fresh attempts weaponizing the flaw as part of a two-stage attack chain to deploy a cryptocurrency miner.   Subsequently, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added  the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to a...",

The three defendants also served as facilitators, hosting the company-issued laptops at their residences and installing remote desktop software on those machines without authorization so that the IT workers could connect to them and give the impression that they were working remotely within the U.S.  Furthermo...",

The campaign essentially involves approaching prospective targets on professional networking sites like LinkedIn, either under the pretext of conducting a job assessment or collaborating on a project, as part of which they are instructed to download a demo project hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.  In one such project spotted by NVISO, it has been found that a file named \"server/config/.config.env\" contains a Base64-encoded value that masquerades as an API key, but, in reality, is a URL ...",

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered critical remote code execution vulnerabilities impacting major artificial intelligence (AI) inference engines, including those from Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, and open-source PyTorch projects such as vLLM and SGLang.  \"These vulnerabilities all traced back to the same root cause: the overlooked unsafe use of ZeroMQ (ZMQ) and Python's pickle deserialization,\" Oligo Security researcher Avi Lumelsky said  in a report published Thursday.  At its core, the issue stems from what has been described as a pattern called ShadowMQ , in which the insecure deserialization logic has propagated to several projects as a result of code reuse.  The root cause is a vulnerability in Meta's Llama large language model (LLM) framework ( CVE-2024-50050 , CVSS score: 6.3/9.3) that was patched by the company last October. Specifically, it involved the use of ZeroMQ's recv_pyobj() method to deserialize incoming data using Python's pickle module.  ...",
