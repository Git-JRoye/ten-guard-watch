      "summary": "OpenAI on Friday said it would start showing ads in ChatGPT to logged-in adult U.S. users in both the free and ChatGPT Go tiers in the coming weeks, as the artificial intelligence (AI) company expanded access  to its low-cost subscription globally.  \"You need to know that your data and conversations are protected and never sold to advertisers,\" OpenAI said . \"And we need to keep a high bar and give you control over your experience, so you see truly relevant, high-quality ads—and can turn off personalization if you want.\"   The company has positioned advertising as a way to ensure that the benefits of artificial general intelligence – a term used to describe a stage in machine learning when an AI system can reach or surpass human-level intelligence – can be made more accessible to the masses. In addition, it can be \"transformative\" for small businesses and emerging brands trying to compete, it added.   It also emphasized that ads do not influence responses...",

      "summary": "The JavaScript (aka JScript) malware loader called GootLoader  has been observed using a malformed ZIP archive that's designed to sidestep detection efforts by concatenating anywhere from 500 to 1,000 archives.  \"The actor creates a malformed archive as an anti-analysis technique,\" Expel security researcher Aaron Walton said  in a report shared with The Hacker News. \"That is, many unarchiving tools are not able to consistently extract it, but one critical unarchiving tool seems to work consistently and reliably: the default tool built into Windows systems.\"  This leads to a scenario where the archive cannot be processed by tools like WinRAR or 7-Zip, and, therefore, prevents many automated workflows from analyzing the contents of the file. At the same time, it can be opened by the default Windows unarchiver, thereby ensuring that victims who fall victim to the social engineering scheme can extract and run the JavaScript malware.  GootLoader is typically distrib...",

      "summary": "Security experts have disclosed details of a new campaign that has targeted U.S. government and policy entities using politically themed lures to deliver a backdoor known as LOTUSLITE .  The targeted malware campaign leverages decoys related to the recent geopolitical developments  between the U.S. and Venezuela to distribute a ZIP archive (\"US now deciding what's next for Venezuela.zip\") containing a malicious DLL that's launched using DLL side-loading techniques. It's not known if the campaign managed to successfully compromise any of the targets.  The activity has been attributed with moderate confidence to a Chinese state-sponsored group known as Mustang Panda  (aka Earth Pret, HoneyMyte, and Twill Typhoon), citing tactical and infrastructure patterns. It's worth noting that the threat actor is known for extensively relying on DLL side-loading to launch its backdoors, including TONESHELL.   \"This campaign reflects a continued trend of targeted spear ...",
