      "summary": "A now-patched security flaw in Samsung Galaxy Android devices was exploited as a zero-day to deliver a \"commercial-grade\" Android spyware dubbed LANDFALL  in targeted attacks in the Middle East.  The activity involved the exploitation of CVE-2025-21042  (CVSS score: 8.8), an out-of-bounds write flaw in the \"libimagecodec.quram.so\" component that could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, according to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42. The issue was addressed  by Samsung in April 2025.  \"This vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild before Samsung patched it in April 2025, following reports of in-the-wild attacks,\" Unit 42 said . Potential targets of the activity, tracked as CL-UNK-1054, are located in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Morocco based on VirusTotal submission data.  The development comes as Samsung disclosed  in September 2025 that another flaw in the same library (CVE-2025-21043, CVSS score: 8.8) had also been exploited in the wild as a...",

The first sign of activity occurred on April 5, 2025, when mass scanning efforts were detected against a server by leveraging various well-known exploits, including CVE-2022-26134  (Atlassian), CVE-2021-44228  (Apache Log4j), CVE-2017-9805  (Apache Struts), and CVE-2017-17562  (GoAhead Web Server).
