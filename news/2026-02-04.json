      "summary": "Microsoft has warned that information-stealing attacks are \"rapidly expanding\" beyond Windows to target Apple macOS environments by leveraging cross-platform languages like Python and abusing trusted platforms for distribution at scale.  The tech giant's Defender Security Research Team said it observed macOS-targeted infostealer campaigns using social engineering techniques such as ClickFix  since late 2025 to distribute disk image (DMG) installers that deploy stealer malware families like Atomic macOS Stealer ( AMOS ), MacSync , and DigitStealer .  The campaigns have been found to use techniques like fileless execution, native macOS utilities, and AppleScript automation to facilitate data theft. This includes details like web browser credentials and session data, iCloud Keychain, and developer secrets.   The starting point of these attacks is often a malicious ad, often served through Google Ads, that redirects users searching for tools like DynamicLake and artificial i...",

      "summary": "The Eclipse Foundation, which maintains the Open VSX Registry, has announced plans to enforce security checks before Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions are published to the open-source repository to combat supply chain threats.  The move marks a shift from a reactive to a proactive approach to ensure that malicious extensions don't end up getting published on the Open VSX Registry.  \"Up to now, the Open VSX Registry has relied primarily on post-publication response and investigation. When a bad extension is reported, we investigate and remove it,\" Christopher Guindon, director of software development at the Eclipse Foundation, said .   \"While this approach remains relevant and necessary, it does not scale as publication volume increases and threat models evolve.\"  The change comes as open-source package registries and extension marketplaces have increasingly become attack magnets, enabling bad actors to target developers at scale through a variet...",

It was addressed by Docker with the release of version 4.50.0  in November 2025.  \"In DockerDash, a single malicious metadata label in a Docker image can be used to compromise your Docker environment through a simple three-stage attack: Gordon AI reads and interprets the malicious instruction, forwards it to the MCP  [Model Context Protocol] Gateway, which then executes it through MCP tools,\" Sasi Levi, security research lead at Noma, said in a report shared with The Hacker News.  \"Every stage happens with zero validation, taking advantage of current agents and MCP Gateway architecture.\"   ...",

      "summary": "Most security teams today are buried under tools. Too many dashboards. Too much noise. Not enough real progress.  Every vendor promises “complete coverage” or “AI-powered automation,” but inside most SOCs, teams are still overwhelmed, stretched thin, and unsure which tools are truly pulling their weight. The result? Bloated stacks, missed signals, and mounting pressure to do more with less.  This live session, \" Breaking Down the Modern SOC: What to Build vs Buy vs Automate ,\"  with Kumar Saurabh (CEO, AirMDR)  and Francis Odum (CEO, SACR) , clears the fog. No jargon. Just real answers to the question every security leader faces: What should we build, what should we buy, and what should we automate?      Secure your spot for the live session ➜     You’ll see what a healthy modern SOC looks like today—how top-performing teams decide where to build, when to buy, and how to automate without losing control.

      "summary": "Threat actors have been observed exploiting a critical security flaw impacting the Metro Development Server in the popular \"@react-native-community/cli\" npm package.  Cybersecurity company VulnCheck said  it first observed exploitation of CVE-2025-11953  (aka Metro4Shell) on December 21, 2025. With a CVSS score of 9.8, the vulnerability allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying host. Details of the flaw were first documented  by JFrog in November 2025.  Despite more than a month after initial exploitation in the wild, the \"activity has yet to see broad public acknowledgment,\" it added.  In the attack detected against its honeypot network, the threat actors have weaponized the flaw to deliver a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that, once parsed, is configured to perform a series of actions, including Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusions for the current working directory and the temporary folder  (...",
