      "summary": "It's getting harder to tell where normal tech ends and malicious intent begins. Attackers are no longer just breaking in — they're blending in, hijacking everyday tools, trusted apps, and even AI assistants. What used to feel like clear-cut \"hacker stories\" now looks more like a mirror of the systems we all use.  This week's findings show a pattern: precision, patience, and persuasion. The newest campaigns don't shout for attention — they whisper through familiar interfaces, fake updates, and polished code. The danger isn't just in what's being exploited, but in how ordinary it all looks.  ThreatsDay pulls these threads together — from corporate networks to consumer tech — revealing how quiet manipulation and automation are reshaping the threat landscape. It's a reminder that the future of cybersecurity won't hinge on bigger walls, but on sharper awareness.",

      "summary": "The encrypted vault backups stolen from the 2022 LastPass data breach have enabled bad actors to take advantage of weak master passwords to crack them open and drain cryptocurrency assets as recently as late 2025, according to new findings from TRM Labs.  The blockchain intelligence firm said  evidence points to the involvement of Russian cybercriminal actors in the activity, with one of the Russian exchanges receiving LastPass-linked funds as recently as October.  This assessment is \"based on the totality of on-chain evidence – including repeated interaction with Russia-associated infrastructure, continuity of control across pre-and post-mix activity, and the consistent use of high-risk Russian exchanges as off-ramps ,\" it added.   LastPass suffered  a major hack in 2022 that enabled attackers to access personal information belonging to its customers, including their encrypted password vaults containing credentials, such as cryptocurrency private keys and seed phrases.   ...",

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2020-12812  (CVSS score: 5.2), an improper authentication vulnerability in SSL VPN in FortiOS that could allow a user to log in successfully without being prompted for the second factor of authentication if the case of the username was changed.  \"This happens when two-factor authentication is enabled in the 'user local' setting, and that user authentication type is set to a remote authentication method (eg, LDAP),\" Fortinet noted  in July 2020. \"The issue exists because of inconsistent case-sensitive matching among the local and remote authentication.\"",

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-52163  (CVSS score: 8.8), relates to a case of command injection that allows post-authentication remote code execution.  \"Digiever DS-2105 Pro contains a missing authorization vulnerability which could allow for command injection via time_tzsetup.cgi,\" CISA said.   The addition of CVE-2023-52163 to the KEV catalog comes in the multiple reports from Akamai and Fortinet about the exploitation of the flaw by threat actors to deliver botnets like Mirai  and ShadowV2 .  According to TXOne Research  security researcher Ta-Lun Yen, the vulnerability, alongside an arbitrary file read bug (CVE-2023-52164, CVSS score: 5.1), remains unpatched due to the device reaching end-of-life (EoL) status.

      "summary": "Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new variant of a macOS information stealer called MacSync  that's delivered by means of a digitally signed, notarized Swift application masquerading as a messaging app installer to bypass Apple's Gatekeeper checks.  \"Unlike earlier MacSync Stealer variants that primarily rely on drag-to-terminal or ClickFix -style techniques, this sample adopts a more deceptive, hands-off approach,\" Jamf researcher Thijs Xhaflaire said .  The Apple device management firm and security company said the latest version is distributed as a code-signed and notarized Swift application within a disk image (DMG) file named \"zk-call-messenger-installer-3.9.2-lts.dmg\" that's hosted on \"zkcall[.]net/download.\"   The fact that it's signed and notarized means it can be run without being blocked or flagged by built-in security controls like Gatekeeper or XProtect.

      "summary": "The fraudulent investment scheme known as Nomani  has witnessed an increase by 62%, according to data from ESET, as campaigns distributing the threat have also expanded beyond Facebook to include other social media platforms, such as YouTube.  The Slovak cybersecurity company said  it blocked over 64,000 unique URLs associated with the threat this year. A majority of the detections originated from Czechia, Japan, Slovakia, Spain, and Poland.  Nomani was first documented  by ESET in December 2024 as leveraging social media malvertising, company-branded posts, and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered video testimonials to deceive users into investing their funds in non-existent investment products that falsely claim significant returns.  When victims request payout of the promised profits, they are asked to pay additional fees or provide additional personal information, such as ID and credit card information. As is typical of investment scams of this kind, the end goal is financial loss...",
